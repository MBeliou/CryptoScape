# CryptoScape
Cryptoscape is a simple Vue + Ionic app using the Coin Gecko API to give some market info on the top marketcap currencies.


## TODO
I shouldn't be spending too much time on this, but in case I do:
- [ ] Add a loading animation between queries
- [ ] Handle query issues
- [ ] Line overflows when resolution too small (iphone 5 for example)
- [ ] Support more currencies
- [ ] User should be able to register a list of currencies to follow

## ISSUES
As of ionic 4, the footer might sometimes not render.
Applying some CSS (see footer-error and bottom-footer in Home.vue) seems to do the trick.
